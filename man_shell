.SH DESCRIPTION
the shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform.
Sh is a command programming language that executes commands read from a terminal or a file.

.SH OPTIONS

-c string
If the -c option is present, then commands are read from string. If there are arguments after the string, they are assigned to the positional parameters, starting with $0.

-i

If the -i option is present, the shell is interactive.

-l

Make bash act as if it had been invoked as a login shell (see INVOCATION below).

-r

If the -r option is present, the shell becomes restricted (see RESTRICTED SHELL below).

-s

If the -s option is present, or if no arguments remain after option processing, then commands are read from the standard input.
This option allows the positional parameters to be set when invoking an interactive shell.

-D

A list of all double-quoted strings preceded by $ is printed on the standard output.
These are the strings that are subject to language translation when the current locale is not C or POSIX.
This implies the -n option; no commands will be executed.
